He took the opportunity to announce the closure of the Curé-Marchand bridge to automobile traffic and appealed to senior citizens to ensure that they scrupulously respect the directives issued by the Quebec government. Since the city observed a large pedestrian traffic on the Curé-Marchand bridge, and since the space dedicated to pedestrians is too narrow to respect the rules of physical distance, the city made the decision to close access to the bridge for motorists. Thus, as citizens still have the right to travel by walking or cycling, and these types of travel are increasing with the arrival of spring, they will be able to use the entire bridge to circulate, while respecting the distance of two meters between each..

336,United Kingdom,England,London,,4/9/2020,,,"TC: NA. MW: Transport for London (TfL) is to temporarily postpone the enforcement of new stricter rules for freight vehicles, which were due to come into force from October 2020, under the Low Emission Zone (LEZ) and Direct Vision Standard, as disrupted supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic have made it more difficult for the new standards to be met on time. TfL has already temporarily suspended the current Low Emission Zone, Congestion Charge and Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) until further notice to help our critical workers get to work and for essential deliveries to take place. The Low Emission Zone, which covers most of Greater London, encourages the most polluting heavy diesel vehicles driving in London to become cleaner by setting minimum standards for emissions. These standards will be tightened for buses, coaches and lorries in line with the tough requirements in place for the central London ULEZ. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has therefore asked TfL to delay enforcement of the new rules for at least four months to give the industry and fleet operators more time to adopt cleaner, safer vehicles. Although the new rules under both schemes will still legally come into force on 26 October, no charges will be payable or enforced for non-compliant vehicles under those new standards until the end of February 2021. The new date for the start of enforcement will be kept under review..

Firstly, a ‘neighbourhood’ approach will be taken to give greater priority to movement on foot and by bike and create a more welcoming urban environment. This will be complemented by a city-wide 30km/hour standard speed limit from 2021. Secondly, a ‘network’ approach will be applied to allow everyone to move around the city easily and safely on foot or by bike. For cycling, an additional 40km of bike corridors will be implemented, using concrete blocks and paint. Major arteries such as Rue de la Loi will be prioritised, with many more in the pipeline.

Not all intersections or accesses will receive city-led signage; signage will be prioritized for routes with higher through-traffic.

For cycling, an additional 40km of bike corridors will be implemented, using concrete blocks and paint. Major arteries such as Rue de la Loi will be prioritised, with many more in the pipeline.

The work involves removing loading bays and parking spaces to provide additional space for pedestrians where there is evidence of footpath congestion.

The neighborhoods of Lazzaretto and Isola will be pilots for Milan as COVID-19 restrictions ease.

To reassure people about the safety of public transport, the Government of Catalonia has launched an app to inform passengers about bus occupancy levels. The new Autocorb app will inform citizens of the occupancy of approaching buses in real time. The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the deployment of this new app, with the aim of ensuring safe physical distance on buses. From 11 May, citizens will be able to find out through the Autocorb app the occupancy of their bus. The new functionality is part of the Intellibus project and involves the 'inLab' FIB laboratory of the Politechnichal University of Catalonia. The user will be presented with estimated occupations of buses throughout the day. In doing so, the government hopes to encourage people to opt for buses with lower occupancy, thus balancing the supply and demand of the service. In the context of the health crisis, this will minimise congestion on buses and help to reduce the spread in the fight against the pandemic..

767,United Kingdom,,nationwide,5/12/2020,4/16/2020,,,"TC: Easier for local authorities to close roads. MW: The United Kingdom's Department for Transport (DfT) has loosened its rules to enable roads to be closed to motor traffic and given over to pedestrians and cyclists during the duration of the COVID-19 lockdown. Typically, any change of use for roads in England had to be enabled by local authorities issuing “Traffic Regulation Orders”—these usually take time to implement, have to be publicized through paid-for advertisements in local newspapers and by on-site notices. They can be stymied by objections. The looser rules—announced on April 16—are “withdrawn once conditions allow,” states the DfT. The DfT’s rule loosening gives local authorities the power to quickly and easily make roads car-free, widen footways, or install temporary cycle lanes. The new guidance on Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) “has been produced in response to concerns about the ability of traffic authorities to implement the publicity requirements when making permanent or temporary TROs during the current crisis."" For the duration of the lockdown local authorities will no longer have to go through a time-consuming and often fractious process to close roads to motor traffic—they will be able to impose emergency TROs with a minimum of advance notice and little recourse to objections..

768,United Kingdom,,nationwide,5/12/2020,5/9/2020,,,"TC: €2.2bn-equivalent investment in cycling infrastructure. MW: Pop-up bicycle lanes with protected space for cycling, wider pavements, safer junctions, and cycle and bus-only corridors will be created in England as part of a £250 million emergency active travel fund - the first stage of a £2 billion investment announced on May 9, 2020, as part of the £5 billion in new funding announced for cycling and buses in February. Following unprecedented levels of walking and cycling across the United Kingdom during the pandemic, the plans will help encourage more people to choose alternatives to public transport when they need to travel, making healthier habits easier and helping make sure the road, bus and rail networks are ready to respond to future increases in demand. Fast-tracked statutory guidance will guide councils to reallocate road space for significantly-increased numbers of cyclists and pedestrians. In towns and cities, some streets could become bicycle and bus-only while others remain available for motorists.

MW: As a result of COVID-19, Humanising Autonomy and Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) collaborated on a pilot designed to improve the safety for all users of public transport interchanges in Manchester. By deploying Humanising Autonomy's behaviour video analysis software, TfGM would be able to detect: adherence to social distancing, number of people and those in groups, directional movement, use of infrastructure and behaviour analysis. The pilot is meant to help inform response and recovery strategies. Data can also be used to better understand capacity for walking and cycling, in order to complement other data streams.

1024,France,Île-de-France,statewide,,6/22/2020,,,"TC: NA. MW: In light of continuing restrictions on public transport, and new-found routines of home-working for many people, Île-de-France is aiming to achieve a permanent switch to intelligent travel management and provide flexibility for employees and ease pressure on public transport during peak hours. The new 'Lissage des Heures de pointe @SmartWork' (Smoothing of Peak Hours @SmartWork) service was launched by the Ile-de-France Region in partnership with Île-de-France Mobilités, Paris La Défense, Grand Paris South, Plaine Commune, RATP and Transilien SNCF. The service allows Île-de-France residents to access information, educational documents and videos to provide them with answers on the main measures to be adopted, including teleworking, shift schedules and alternative mobility to public transport. Through testimonials, concrete actions, and good practices put in place by employers or the regions involved in the process, citizens will be inspired to think differently about their daily travel habits. This approach has been inspired by a first experiment in smoothing peak hours initiated by the Region in 2018, with a first charter signed in the territory of Paris La Défense, which brings together businesses, transport operators and the territory. It was subsequently extended to the territories of Grand Paris Sud and Plaine Commune..

1026,United States,California,Oakland,6/25/2020,6/19/2020,,,"TC: restaurants & retail may use sidewalks and on-street parking spaces. MW: The City of Oakland announced it will waive all fees and is streamlining permitting for business’ use of public rights-of-way, including sidewalks and parking lanes, to align with Alameda County’s updated Shelter-in-Place Order allowing outdoor dining and other merchant activities. The goal is to spur equitable economic recovery by making it easier for retailers, restaurants and others to allow businesses to use larger portions of the sidewalk, parking lanes and streets. The program strives to support local restaurants and retailers, support Oakland residents, improve traffic safety and ensure and advance racial equity. Flex Streets will be implemented in phases starting with sidewalk and parking lane areas. Oakland recognizes not all streets and neighborhoods are the same, and staff are developing options for businesses to safely extend their operations and physically distance their customers. Oakland will post signs around commercial areas notifying community members and businesses of the program and soliciting feedback for areas of improvement and is surveying the business community on how streets and sidewalks can be used.
 
 Flex Streets also includes an expedited permitting process for mobile food vendors to help some of Oakland’s smallest micro-businesses that are often owned by low-income people of color to help them operate safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, Flex Streets removes the limit on the number of mobile food vending permits available, allows vending from multiple locations, and eliminates the mobile food vending permitting fee..

With space for cycling increasing across the city in response to COVID-19, new guidelines have been issued to ensure that deliveries are considered when closing streets to traffic or implementing new cycle lanes. To support sustainable logistics post-lockdown and reliance on private vehicles, a shared electric-vehicle service for commercial operators is being rolled out to facilitate zero-emission deliveries for businesses in Paris. This scheme was already in operation, but is now being sped up in light of the conditions for mobility created by the pandemic. A toolkit for businesses has also been issued to assist with ensuring safe physical distancing outside and around shops.
